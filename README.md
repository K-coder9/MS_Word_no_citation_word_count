How it works:
Make sure to save the word file in the same directory as in this current script.
Make sure to install the relevant modules on your computer using 'pip install python-doxc'.
When the script starts runnning it will prompt the user to 'Please enter your document name: '.
Type in the name of the file without '.doxc' file extension.
The script will display: 'The word count is : ' then end.
